Stock Market Analysis and Forecasting

Overview
This project focuses on analyzing historical stock data and forecasting future prices for key companies: AAPL, MSFT, NFLX, and GOOG. The main objectives are to visualize stock performance, analyze statistical properties, and forecast future stock prices using a Vector Autoregression (VAR) model.

Project Structure
data_collection.py: Script to download and preprocess historical stock data.
visualization.py: Scripts for various visualizations, including stock price trends and forecasted prices.
analysis.py: Script to perform statistical analysis, including stationarity tests and differencing.
forecasting.py: Script to build and fit the VAR model and forecast future stock prices.
